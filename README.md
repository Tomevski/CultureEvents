This app is used to be in time with the actual cuture events near you.
Whole idea is to collect points for every event you are attending.
The points are used as a discount on ticket for following events.

News feed view is also Home view which presents the following events near you.

The last view of the application is "My profile".
Every time when you buy a ticket for an event you are getting code.
That code you can use for filling the progress bar.
When the progress bar is filled up you can use the points as a discount on ticket.
